# AGENTS.md — A Pachas

A Pachas is a single-page app for splitting party expenses among the Collado
Hermoso crew. There is no build step, no framework, and no dependency install:
the whole frontend lives in `public/index.html` and the whole backend lives in
`server/api.js`.

## Repository Map

- `public/index.html` — the entire frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
- `server/api.js` — the shared-party API: create/read/save with optimistic
  revisions; in local development it also serves `public/`.
- `docs/product.md` — product specification: diagnosis, decisions, P0
  acceptance criteria, and backlog.
- `docs/design.md` — identity and UI rules: logo, exact tokens, typography,
  user-facing voice, and screen structure.
- `compose.yaml` — server stack: nginx, API, and cloudflared.
- `deployment/nginx/default.conf` — nginx static serving plus `/api/` proxy.
- `scripts/deploy.sh` — one-command deployment from the Mac.
- `docs/deployment.md` — infrastructure runbook.

## Language Policy

1. Source code, identifiers, implementation comments, commit messages, and
   technical/repository documentation must be written in English.
2. User-facing product copy stays in Spanish from Spain, with the village tone
   defined in `docs/design.md`.
3. The admin role is called "la llave" in the UI. In code and docs, call it
   "admin" or "key holder" unless quoting visible product copy.
4. Persisted data fields, API payloads, endpoints, filenames, internal CSS
   classes, and local implementation identifiers are English. Spanish is only
   for user-facing product copy.

## Rules

1. Keep the frontend and backend as one self-contained file each. Do not add a
   build system, framework, runtime dependency, or `npm install` unless the user
   explicitly asks for it. The only agreed exception is Google Fonts, with a
   system fallback.
2. Use the current English-only data contract. The localStorage key is
   `a-pachas-v2`; live links use `#F:id:key`; local snapshot links use `AP2:`.
   Do not add Spanish payload aliases unless explicitly requested.
3. Local mode must keep working. If the API is unavailable, the app remains
   usable from localStorage and explains the situation without technical jargon.
4. The deployment server is shared with the World Cup pool production app. Do
   not touch the `current` or `staging` stacks.
5. Cloudflare tunnel credentials never enter the repo.
6. Verify before declaring work done. Run the local app with `node
   server/api.js` and test the full mobile flow: create, join by link, list,
   quick expense, bought item with price and consumers, Bizums, and share
   messages. After deployment, confirm `https://apachas.alexdepablos.es`
   responds; `scripts/deploy.sh` already checks web and API health.

## Testing

Local live-party mode:

```sh
node server/api.js
```

Open `http://localhost:8010`. For frontend-only local mode:

```sh
python3 -m http.server -d public
```

Test on a mobile viewport around 390px wide. There is no automated test suite;
verification is browser-based.
