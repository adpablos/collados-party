# AGENTS.md — A Pachas

A Pachas is a single-page app for splitting party expenses among the Collado
Hermoso crew. There is no build step, no framework, and no dependency install:
the whole frontend lives in `public/index.html` and the whole backend lives in
`server/api.js`.

## Repository Map

- `public/index.html` — the entire frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
- `server/api.js` — the shared-party API: create/read/save, soft delete/restore,
  optimistic revisions, audit, rate limits, and privacy-safe telemetry; in local
  development it also serves `public/`.
- `docs/product.md` — product specification: diagnosis, decisions, P0
  acceptance criteria, and backlog.
- `docs/design.md` — identity and UI rules: logo, exact tokens, typography,
  user-facing voice, and screen structure.
- `compose.yaml` — server stack: nginx, API, and cloudflared.
- `deployment/nginx/default.conf` — nginx static serving plus `/api/` proxy.
- `deployment/nginx/security-headers.conf` — generated CSP plus shared headers.
- `tests/` and `scripts/check.sh` — dependency-free API/browser-core checks.
- `deployment/systemd/` and `scripts/*backup*` — encrypted backup and restore
  verification tooling.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — canonical user-visible and operational release notes.
- `scripts/deploy.sh` — one-command deployment from the Mac.
- `docs/deployment.md` — infrastructure runbook.

## Language Policy

1. Source code, identifiers, implementation comments, commit messages, and
   technical/repository documentation must be written in English.
2. User-facing product copy stays in Spanish from Spain, with the village tone
   defined in `docs/design.md`.
3. The admin role is called "la llave" in the UI. In code and docs, call it
   "admin" or "key holder" unless quoting visible product copy.
4. Persisted data fields, API payloads, endpoints, filenames, internal CSS
   classes, and local implementation identifiers are English. Spanish is only
   for user-facing product copy.

## Rules

1. Keep the frontend and backend as one self-contained file each. Do not add a
   build system, framework, runtime dependency, or `npm install` unless the user
   explicitly asks for it. The only agreed exception is Google Fonts, with a
   system fallback.
2. Use the current English-only data contract. The localStorage key is
   `a-pachas-v2`; edit links use `#F:id:key`, read-only links use `#R:id`, and
   local snapshot links use `AP2:`.
   Do not add Spanish payload aliases unless explicitly requested. Shared state
   is v6: bought-item consumers are explicit IDs, people have an `active` flag,
   and completed Bizums are transfer entities that affect balances. Recent live
   party pointers use `a-pachas-recent-v1` and remain local to the phone.
3. Local mode must keep working. If the API is unavailable, the app remains
   usable from localStorage and explains the situation without technical jargon.
4. The deployment server is shared with the World Cup pool production app. Do
   not touch the `current` or `staging` stacks.
5. Cloudflare tunnel credentials never enter the repo.
6. Add one concise bullet under `Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` for changes to
   product behavior, persisted data, security, privacy, deployment, or
   recovery. Pure refactors and test-only changes do not need an entry unless
   they affect those contracts. Never rewrite a released section.
7. Verify before declaring work done. Run `scripts/check.sh`, then run the local
   app with `node server/api.js` and test the full mobile flow: create, join by
   edit and read-only links, list,
   quick expense, bought item with price and consumers, Bizums, a later expense
   after a completed Bizum, inactive participants, recent-party reopening, and
   share messages. After deployment, confirm `https://apachas.alexdepablos.es`
   responds; `scripts/deploy.sh` already checks web and API health.

## Testing

Local live-party mode:

```sh
node server/api.js
```

Automated quality gate:

```sh
scripts/check.sh
```

Open `http://localhost:8010`. For frontend-only local mode:

```sh
python3 -m http.server -d public
```

Test on a mobile viewport around 390px wide. Automated checks cover the API and
core state behavior; the complete interaction and responsive flow remain
browser-based.
